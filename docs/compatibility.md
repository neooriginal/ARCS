# 🤝 Compatibility

ARCS is designed to work with specific robotic platforms, primarily focusing on **XLeRobot**-based systems.

## ✅ Supported Robots

### [XLeRobot](https://xlerobot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)-compatible Systems
ARCS supports robots building on the XLeRobot standard with the following configuration:

*   **Manipulators**: Right Arm Only
    *   ⚠️ **Left Arm**: While present in the standard XLeRobot guide, it is **not yet supported** in ARCS.
    *   📡 **USB LIDAR Sensor**: For AI navigation
*   **Optional Additions**:
    *   *These are not part of the original XLeRobot spec but are supported by ARCS:*
    *   🔊 **Speakers**: For Text-to-Speech.
    *   📺 **HDMI Screen**: For visual feedback and expressions.

## 🚧 Future Support

For other robot configurations or custom hardware:
